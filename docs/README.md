# StoreBunk POS Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the **StoreBunk POS** library.

## Project Overview

StoreBunk POS is the **operational execution layer of retail transactions** for the StoreBunk Multi-Retail Platform. It is a domain-centric Point of Sale core designed to operate as a **framework-agnostic PHP library**, focusing on pure business logic without UI components.

Built using **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, **Event Sourcing (ES)**, **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**, and **CQRS**.
